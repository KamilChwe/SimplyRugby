Graded Unit Project for HND: Software Development.
This is the full Implementation of the project that I've done for my College Graded Unit.

What started as a small project for my GU that had a JSON database ended up as a big and convoluted mess of research and pain.
I honestly thought this would be simpler but it was pain, so much time was wasted on features that had simpler solutions but I just could not fit them in properly.
This code is a mess, but its a functional mess!
